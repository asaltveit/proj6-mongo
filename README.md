# proj6-mongo
Simple list of dated memos kept in MongoDB database

## Author
Anna Saltveit

## What is here

A simple Flask app that displays all the dated memos it finds in a MongoDB database.
There is also a 'scaffolding' program, db_trial.py, for inserting a couple records into the database 
and printing them out.  

## Functionality added

Memos are dated, listed in order of recent date and are deletable.
